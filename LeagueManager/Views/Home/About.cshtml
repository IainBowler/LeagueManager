<p>
    League Manager is a project that I started to help me learn asp.net. <br />
    The project is an MVC 5 Web Application using the 4.5.2 .NET Framework. <br />
    It is using Individual User Accounts. <br />
    It is built using a code first approach with the Entity Framework. <br />
    Created the Side class with scaffolded Create, Details, Edit and Delete Views.<br />
    Created the League class with scaffolded Create, Details, Edit and Delete Views.<br />
    Created the Match class with scaffolded Create, Details, Edit and Delete Views.<br />
    Added data Annotations to League scaffolded Side. <br />
    Added foreign keys for the Match class with fluent api. <br />
    Merged all the create, details, edit and delete for the three classes into Administrator controller. <br />
    Added UserName to register and logon. <br />
    Created View Models for League, Side and Match to create the data for list boxes. <br />
    Added confirmation to deleting Sides if they have matches associated with them. <br />
    Added Test data to DbInitialiser. <br />
    Put much of what could be reused in the views into partial views. <br />
    Tidied up appearance of views. <br />
    Changed the way League editing was done so that Sides are added/removed on a separate page to enable deleting associated matches. <br />
    Created SideResults and LeagueResults to generate the data needed for a League Table, added League Table View. <br />
    Created a copy of the Administration controller called MyLeagues (with Views). <br />
    Added showing of Owner Name if user is Administrator. <br />
    Created an Admin user with an Admin Role. <br />
    Added Authorisation to Administrator and MyLeagues controllers. <br />
    Changed MyLeagues controller so it could only access the current users data. <br />
    Added Premiership data to DbInitialiser. <br />
    Added Public Leagues controller to display Leagues that are public. <br />
    Tidied up front page and navigation. <br />
    Added Demo User data and created a guide to using the site. <br />
